## [1.2.0 build 12] - 2026-10-07 — restore of the verified 2026-08-27 state

### Restored

- **Full Disk Access works again.** `ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX` is removed from the
  app and test build configurations and `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` is
  removed from `SalmanMacCleaner.entitlements`. App Sandbox cannot be combined
  with full-disk maintenance: while it was enabled the app could not read
  `~/Library`, other volumes or protected locations, so scans degraded even
  with Full Disk Access granted. `Tools/validate_project.py` once again fails
  if the sandbox is switched back on.
- **Smart Care no longer stalls at 50%.** The application factor of the
  one-click health check uses the bounded bundle count again instead of the
  full applications inventory (which measured, signed and metadata-queried
  every bundle on the machine).
- **"Back to Smart Care" navigation** restored in Duplicate Finder and in
  Startup & Background Items.
- **Compact window layout** restored: 980 × 640 minimum, 1180 × 760 default,
  compact sidebar width, and the sidebar inset that keeps the first row clear
  of the macOS title-bar controls.
- **Trash safety restored.** Permanent deletion and "Empty Trash" again
  validate every candidate path against the real Trash roots
  (`~/.Trash` plus per-volume trashes) with a standardised prefix check,
  instead of matching any path that merely contains the substring `.Trash`.
  Restore is disabled for entries whose original path is unknown.
- **Regression tests restored** in `DuplicateFinderTests.swift`,
  `PathSafetyTests.swift` and `AppIdentityTests.swift` (the earlier compile-fix
  pass had deleted tests and weakened assertions).

### Fixed

- Release builds are packaged with `ditto -c -k --keepParent` instead of
  `zip -r`; `zip` follows symlinks and corrupts `.app` bundles.
- Release builds are ad-hoc signed (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-"`) so the app can
  launch on Apple Silicon, with a loud unsigned fallback.
- CI no longer publishes `v1.0.<run number>` releases from `main` pushes.
  Release tags now match the product version. The misleading `v1.0.6` /
  `v1.0.13` release names came from workflow run numbers, not from the app.
- CI no longer force-commits build logs and API dumps (`build.log`,
  `test.log`, `run_status*.json`, `jobs*.json`, …) to the repository; those
  files were deleted and logs are uploaded as workflow artifacts.
- Stale repository URLs (`8002salman-ai/SalmanMacCleaner`) updated to
  `salmanbashir80/SalmanMacCleaner`.

### Verified

- Restored source compiles and the XCTest suite passes on macOS
  (GitHub Actions `CI` runs 37675648454 on `5757d6f` and 37679861978 on the final
  tree `7d6ebac`, `macos-14` / Xcode 15.2: unit tests, Debug build, Release build
  and packaging all succeeded).
- The first run on this branch caught three real concurrency errors in the restored
  `TrashBinsView.swift` (`expression is 'async' but is not marked with 'await'`,
  captured `found`/`total` in concurrently-executing code); they are fixed and the
  follow-up run passed.

### Removed

- `SalmanMacCleaner/Features/TrashBins/TrashValidator.swift` — never added to
  the Xcode project and not referenced by any code path.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- **Product rename to 8002CleanUp (visible name).** The bundle name,
  display name, About screen, app menu title (via `CFBundleName`), updater
  copy, health-check copy, security-audit copy and the version badge all
  now consistently read **8002CleanUp**. The repository name, Xcode target
  and bundle identifier are unchanged so Sparkle feeds, saved bookmarks and
  support paths keep working.
- Version bumped to **1.2.0 (build 8)** — the next release after the
  previously installed 1.1.7 (7). A single `AppIdentity` type is now the
  source of truth for the visible name and `v<version> (<build>)` badge,
  used by the sidebar header, toolbar badge and About screen.
- Sidebar now shows an 8002CleanUp identity header (icon, name, version
  badge) at the top so the running build is always identifiable.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Finder** now captures and displays the measured modified
  date for every reported copy (including the keeper), reports the total
  bytes considered alongside files/directories, and streams live
  files/bytes counters and elapsed time while scanning with a Cancel
  button and an explicit Retry action on error or partial coverage.
- **Large & Old Files** now shows live entries-visited/bytes-found/elapsed
  progress while scanning, offers a deterministic sort menu (largest,
  smallest, newest, oldest, name), and a "Scan This Folder" retry action.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Added a read-only One-Click Health Check with measured storage, Trash, cache, application, background-item and permission factors, live aggregate progress, cancellation, coverage warnings and links into the detailed modules.
- Hardened Trash-only cleanup reconciliation: explicit category/root allowlists, canonical and ownership revalidation, symlink and hard-link safety, exact selected/moved/failed/remaining accounting, and preservation of failed or remaining rows after a run.
- Completed bounded, cancellable scanner safeguards and honest partial/truncated reporting for Space Lens, developer caches, duplicates, large-file review and health measurements.
- Improved application and leftover inventories with bundle metadata, exact bundle-ID evidence, publisher/signing/runtime information, protected Apple/current/running/ambiguous entries, and safer support-file handling.
- Polished compact SwiftUI module controls and release-status copy so preview actions, Trash actions, version/build metadata and updater limitations are accurately labelled.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Prevented Space Lens from crashing while opening or starting a scan by replacing fragile AppKit/CoreUI-backed loading and root glyph UI with native SwiftUI drawing.
- Removed the recursive scanner's overlapping `inout` counter access, which triggered a Swift exclusivity fatal error as soon as live progress was reported.
- Added the installed app version to the top toolbar so the running build is always identifiable.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **Full Disk Access fresh probing, instant refresh and 5 distinct states.**
  - Replaced stale permission logic with non-destructive directory listing and file handle probes on known TCC locations (`~/Library/Safari`, `~/Library/Messages`, `~/Library/Mail`, `~/Library/Suggestions`, `~/Library/PersonalizationPortrait`) and standard user roots (`~`, `~/Library`, `~/Library/Caches`, `~/Library/Logs`, `~/Library/Application Support`, `/Applications`).
  - Distinguishes Granted, Limited, Folder-only, Denied, and Unknown states.
  - Automatic refresh on launch, scene activation (`scenePhase == .active`), Permissions view appearance, and return from System Settings (`NSApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification`), plus manual "Check Again" button.
  - Added last checked timestamp, accessible/inaccessible roots breakdown, Open Settings, Check Again, and Quit & Reopen action. All badges and status pills refresh immediately.
- **Cleanup accounting, root deduplication and exact reconciliation.**
  - Diagnosed and fixed the 2.69–3.3 GB vs 47.5 MB accounting discrepancy: removed overlapping roots in `ScanPolicy.resolve`, pruned descendant paths when parent folders are selected to prevent double counting, canonicalized file paths, and deduplicated identical file identities (hard links).
  - Count moved bytes strictly when `FileManager.trashItem` succeeds; exact reconciliation enforced: `selected = moved + failed + skipped + notProcessed`.
  - Post-cleanup index eviction for moved directories and all descendants, database recalculation of category totals, UI item removal, and updated `AppState.lastOutcome`.
  - Preserved strict Trash-only safety: no `rm`, `sudo`, permanent deletion, emptying Trash, SIP bypass, symlink traversal, or system path modification.
- **Compact native SwiftUI glass workspace for Results Workspace.**
  - Replaced oversized white window with a compact glass workspace (approx 980x680 minimum).
  - Eliminated page-level scrolling; only the result list container scrolls.
  - Added collapsible category rail, search/sort toolbar (Size, Name, Date), rows with checkbox, icon, name, full path tooltip, source, size, safety badge, and context actions (Reveal in Finder, Quick Look).
  - Added sticky bottom glass action bar with selected count, unique bytes, Preview toggle, and glowing rounded Clean / Move to Trash button with Aurora styling.
- **Space Lens from actual measured inventory.**
  - Replaced blank / Zero KB display with explicit states: Not scanned, Scanning, Partial, Denied, and Measured — never displaying Zero KB for an unscanned root.
  - Added real-time progress: current path, files scanned, bytes indexed, elapsed time, inaccessible paths count, and responsive cancellation.
  - Bounded concurrency, no symlink traversal, depth bounding, and persisted inventory cache with invalidation on rescan.
  - Proportional bubble visualization in Canvas, synchronized list, drill-down, breadcrumbs bar, Back/Forward navigation history, hover tooltip details, search, sort, and Reveal in Finder. System folders protected and personal files never auto-selected.
- **Scan performance & safety test coverage.**
  - Hashing scoped strictly to same-size duplicate candidates; deduplicated scan roots; batched SQLite transactions; throttled UI updates off the main actor.
  - Added deterministic unit tests for parent-child double counting pruning, canonical duplicate paths, hard link deduplication, successful/failed Trash move reconciliation, cleanup rescan & index eviction, regenerated cache protection, FDA refresh & states, Space Lens explicit states, proportional bubble packing, and system path protections.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **Cleanup workflow (Preview Mode wording, real Trash moves, exact counts).**
  - Preview Mode no longer offers "Move to Trash": the action is
    "Preview Selected" and the dialog confirms with "Confirm Preview".
    Preview never reaches the Trash API (asserted by a mock mover test).
  - A real run is labelled "Move Selected to Trash", revalidates every
    item and moves it with `FileManager.trashItem(at:resultingItemURL:)`.
    Nothing is permanently deleted and the Trash is never emptied.
  - The uninstaller's confirmation dialog was never attached, so its
    `performCleanup()` was unreachable; it is now wired, and a selected
    removable app moves through a narrow authorized-root grant (the
    bundle path itself) while system apps, running apps, other users'
    files and preferences are refused with an exact reason.
  - Counts, bytes, banners and history are now exact and self-reconciling:
    `selected == moved + previewed + failed + skipped + notProcessed`,
    with per-item skip/failure reasons and a "Reveal in Trash" action.
  - Moved items are removed from the results, evicted from the scan index
    and subtracted from the header totals; a cancelled run always ends the
    activity banner and records what actually ran.
- **Deep Scan "Items scanned: 1" defect.** Root causes, all fixed:
  - The directory enumerator yields the scan root itself first; it was
    recorded as a file (nil-defaulted `isDirectory`) and the first failed
    root validation pruned the whole subtree via `skipDescendants()`.
    Roots are now never counted and never prune the scan; `isDirectory`
    comes from `lstat` ground truth.
  - `PathSafety.validate` rejected every non-home path and every data-
    volume path (APFS system/data device split) as cross-volume. A root
    grant model now distinguishes granted roots (home, user Library,
    security-scoped authorized folders) from not-granted roots (volume
    roots without Full Disk Access), and the granted system+data volume
    pair is one device group.
  - Coverage outcomes were optimistically set to "scanned" before the
    scan ran. Coverage is now built exclusively from the real per-root
    scanner results; not-granted/denied roots are listed with exact
    reasons and force "Limited coverage" in the UI — "complete" is only
    ever reported after genuine traversal.
  - Junk classification treated any path containing "Library"/"Caches"/
    "Logs" as protected, so all cache candidates were PROTECTED ("Zero KB
    candidates"). Classification is now driven by the scan's actual
    root tables (library/review roots), with protected-component checks
    limited to top-level personal folders and VCS trees.
- Quick/Balanced/Deep roots redesigned: Quick keeps high-value junk
  locations; Balanced adds the full home; Deep adds home + volume roots
  (FDA-gated) + /Applications (readable, FDA-gated) + authorized folders.
- Incremental scans now respect the user setting; opportunity roots that
  don't exist are dropped instead of reported as denied.

### Added

- **"Choose folders for Deep Scan"**: `NSOpenPanel` + persisted
  security-scoped bookmarks (`FolderAuthorizationsStore`), managed in the
  Deep Scan hero and Settings → Permissions; scopes stay active for the
  scan duration.
- Root-by-root coverage details with state, reason and per-root denied
  counts in the results workspace; "Limited coverage" pill + Full Disk
  Access deep-link; honest zero-candidates explanation.
- `Tools/verify_deepscan.sh` — build + regression-suite + manual GUI
  verification checklist.
- `DeepScanRegressionTests` (10 tests): multi-file fixture inventories,
  root-never-counted regression, fixture cache/log SAFE classification,
  protected-file skipping, unreadable/missing roots never "scanned",
  limited-vs-complete coverage, root grant matrix.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Aurora Glass design system**: semantic color tokens, immersive midnight/
  indigo/violet gradient, animated aurora illumination (static under Reduce
  Motion), glass surfaces, native Liquid Glass on macOS 26 behind
  `#available` + `#if compiler(>=6.2)` guards, `.ultraThinMaterial` fallback.
- **Premium sidebar** with all 20 modules (MAIN/CLEANUP/STORAGE/
  APPLICATIONS/HEALTH/OTHER), capsule selection, distinct hover/pressed/
  focus states, original Canvas artwork per module.
- **Hero screens** for every module: benefit, three capabilities, scope and
  scan-mode selectors, anchored primary action, last-scan and permission
  warnings.
- **Four genuine scan modes**: Quick, Balanced, Deep and Custom via
  `ScanPolicy`, with 13-phase `DeepScanCoordinator`, pause/resume/cancel,
  thermal auto-pause, battery-aware hashing and honest coverage reports.
- **Deep scan engine** (`Engine/`): `VolumeDiscoveryService`,
  `FileInventoryScanner`, `TraversalPolicy`, `MetadataCollector`,
  `JunkClassifier` (SAFE/REVIEW/PROTECTED), `ApplicationInventoryService`
  (fixes the previous ~2-app discovery bug), `ResidualCorrelationEngine`,
  `DuplicatePipeline`, `ScanProgressAggregator`, `ScanCoverageReport`,
  `ScanIndexStore` (SQLite, migrations, checkpoints, resume),
  `IncrementalScanSupport` (public FSEvents), `CleanupPlanBuilder`,
  `CleanupSafetyValidator`, `CleanupExecutor`, `IgnoreListStore`, `ScanGate`.
- **Results workspace**: summary ring, tiles, category navigation,
  virtualized item list, coverage inspector, sticky action bar with a
  deliberate Preview-Mode control and second confirmation.
- **Space Lens**: real hierarchical bubble visualization (Canvas circle
  packing), hover-synchronized list, drill-in, breadcrumbs, back/forward,
  "Other" aggregation for huge folders.
- **Applications + Uninstaller**: inventory from /Applications,
  ~/Applications, /System/Applications (read-only) and nested folders;
  Mach-O architecture reading; signing and quarantine state; exact-ID
  component matching; running-app protection.
- **App Leftovers**, **Trash Bins**, **My Clutter**, **Large & Old Files**,
  **System Junk**, **Smart Care**, **Deep Scan** modules.
- **Security Audit** (FDA probe, quarantine flags, unsigned/broken agents —
  no fake malware claims), **Performance** (thermal, memory/storage
  pressure, sampled per-app CPU), **Permissions** (FDA onboarding with
  likely/limited/not-determined/denied wording).
- **Activity & History** with search, filter, JSON/CSV export, path
  redaction and clear-with-confirmation.
- **Sparkle 2** via Swift Package Manager with a configuration gate
  (updates disabled in unsigned/placeholder builds), plus CI and release
  workflows (Developer ID, notarization, stapling, `spctl` verification,
  EdDSA-signed appcast) that fail loudly without secrets.
- 60+ tests including a fixture end-to-end inventory→plan→preview→execute
  flow, engine classification, residuals, SQLite index, Space Lens
  aggregation and Mach-O parsing.

### Changed

- Startup Manager rewritten on SMAppService + supported locations (no
  deprecated LSSharedFileList), with broken-reference detection.
- Settings reorganized into General/Scanning/Safety/Permissions/Updates/
  Advanced/About.
- `Tools/generate_pbxproj.py` now generates the project deterministically.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Native SwiftUI app for macOS 13+, Swift 5.9, Apple Silicon (arm64).
- Premium SwiftUI interface: sidebar navigation, dashboard, search, filters,
  sort controls, progress indicators, cancellation, light/dark/system
  appearance, VoiceOver-friendly labels.
- Dashboard with storage overview: volume ring chart, per-folder usage bars,
  purgeable space, safety posture summary and quick actions.
- Preview-first Safe Cleanup: dry-run mode ON by default, explicit item
  selection, second confirmation dialog, trash-only removal.
- Large File Finder: scans user-selected folders only, depth-limited,
  threshold from Settings, sortable and searchable results.
- Developer cache scanner: Xcode DerivedData/Archives/Simulator data, SwiftPM,
  CocoaPods, npm, Yarn, pnpm, Gradle, Maven, Cargo, pip and Homebrew caches.
- Read-only Startup Manager: login items, launch agents and launch daemons are
  listed but never modified in version 1.
- Streaming SHA-256 Duplicate Finder for explicitly selected folders, with
  size pre-filtering, hard-link awareness and a kept copy per group.
- Cautious Application Uninstaller with High/Medium/Caution confidence labels,
  support-file matching, and a hard block on running apps.
- Non-sensitive browser/application cache cleaning (cookies, history,
  sessions, saved passwords and personal data are always protected).
- Local cleanup history with JSON and CSV export; corrupt history files are
  tolerated gracefully.
- Settings: large-file threshold, exclusions, scan depth, dev-cache categories,
  dev-cache age, appearance mode and master dry-run toggle.
- Central path-safety policy (`Core/PathSafety.swift`): canonicalization,
  symlink containment, ownership checks, device boundaries, protected-root
  and protected-name classification.
- Immediate revalidation before every filesystem mutation (TOCTOU protection).
- Cancellable cooperative scans via structured concurrency.
- Unit test suite (`SalmanMacCleanerTests`) covering protected paths, personal
  paths, traversal, symlinks, ownership, preview-only mode, revalidation,
  selected-items-only cleanup, trash-only behavior, duplicate grouping,
  streaming hashes, hard links, cancellation, history and permission failures.
- Structural project validator (`Tools/validate_project.py`) for CI.

### Security

- No Full Disk Access or admin/root requirement for the core app.
- No shell execution, no `sudo`, no `rm`, no `Process`/`NSTask`, no `system()`,
  no `popen()`, no network calls — enforced by design and by the validator.
- Never permanently deletes files and never empties the Trash.
- `/System`, `/Library`, `/private`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/Applications`,
  `/Volumes`, `/Network`, `/dev`, `/cores` and other root locations are
  hard-blocked; Desktop/Documents/Downloads/Pictures/Music/Movies are never
  scanned by default; other-user files, keychains, browser privacy data,
  personal documents, source repositories, cloud databases, Time Machine
  backups and VM disks are protected.
- Recursive scans never follow symlinks, never cross mounted volumes, and
  never follow symlink loops.
- Running applications are never removed.

### Known limitations

- Startup Manager is intentionally read-only in version 1.
- Cleanup moves items to the Trash; the user (or Finder) empties the Trash.
- Uninstaller only offers apps from `~/Applications`; system-wide apps are
  never offered.

## [Unreleased]

- Startup item management (safe, explicit toggle-only) — planned.
- App Store distribution pipeline — planned.
- More developer cache locations (uv, Bun, RubyGems) — planned.
