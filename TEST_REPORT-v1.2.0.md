# 8002CleanUp v1.2.0 Verification Report

Date: 2026-08-26
Product rename: **Salman Mac Cleaner → 8002CleanUp**
Version: **1.2.0 (build 8)** — next release after the previously installed 1.1.7 (7)

---

## 1. Scope

This pass continued from the latest remote code on `arena/01a03a86-salmanmaccleaner`
(commit `226b9da`, "fix: populate duplicate finder roots", which already contains
the v1.1.4–v1.1.7 module repairs: duplicate pipeline, large-file picker,
developer caches, Space Lens, health check, cleanup reconciliation, tests).
All work was performed on the session branch
`arena/01a03de8-salmanmaccleaner`, which was fast-forwarded to `226b9da`
(latest remote work) before editing, so **no older baseline** was used.

## 2. Product rename + version (done)

- `Info.plist`: `CFBundleName` and `CFBundleDisplayName` → **8002CleanUp**.
- `project.pbxproj`: `MARKETING_VERSION = 1.2.0`, `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 8`
  (app + test configs). `Tools/generate_pbxproj.py` constants synced to 1.2.0/8.
- New `Core/AppIdentity.swift` — single source of truth for
  `displayName`, `shortVersion`, `buildNumber`, `versionBadge`, `helpText`;
  used by the toolbar version badge, the new sidebar identity header and the
  About screen.
- Sidebar now shows **8002CleanUp + v1.2.0 (8)** in a compact glass header at
  the top (icon, name, badge, Reduce Motion-aware glow).
- About screen, updater copy, menu help title, security/health copy and all
  localization keys updated to 8002CleanUp; README, CHANGELOG, Docs, SECURITY,
  FILE_MANIFEST updated.
- Internal identifiers intentionally unchanged: repository name, Xcode target
  `SalmanMacCleaner`, bundle id `com.salman.SalmanMacCleaner`, Sparkle feed URL,
  support paths — so signed feeds, saved bookmarks and historical data keep
  working. Restarting/reinstalling via the existing distribution flow shows the
  new visible name.

## 3. Duplicate Finder audit — remaining gaps fixed

Verified from code (all pre-existing requirements intact):
- Roots: Desktop/Documents/Downloads/Pictures/Movies/Music (existing only) +
  Choose Folder + Choose External Folder; **no auto-scan** (Scan button only).
- Exact-content hashing (size group → sample → full streaming SHA-256),
  hard-link identity groups, symlink-safe bounded traversal, no automatic
  keeper selection, preview → confirmation → Trash-only move.

Fixed in this pass:
- **Modified dates**: the scanner now collects `.contentModificationDateKey`;
  every reported copy and the keeper show the measured modified date.
- **Files/bytes scanned + elapsed + cancelling**: live throttled counters
  (files, bytes, elapsed `m:ss`), current phase, Cancel Scan button; Retry
  button on error/partial coverage.
- **Sorting**: sort menu (reclaimable space, file size, copies, path).
- **Select All / Deselect All**: functional; Select All never selects keepers
  (tested).
- Coverage summary now includes considered bytes.

## 4. Large & Old Files audit — remaining gaps fixed

Verified from code: explicit folder picker (dismiss on Cancel/selection),
custom folders, real size/date rows, checkbox selection, preview-first Trash.

Fixed in this pass:
- Live progress: entries visited, bytes found, elapsed time.
- Sort menu: largest, smallest, newest modified, oldest modified, name
  (deterministic, unit-tested).
- "Scan This Folder" retry action.

## 5. Other module audit (static, against the requirement list)

| Module | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Deep Scan / Smart Care | Real traversal, coverage/denied counters, bounded tasks, read-only Health Check (no auto clean/uninstall/update/disable). No changes needed. |
| System Junk / Developer Caches | Real paths/sizes; category chooser with only detected categories; not-scanned/empty/denied states. No changes needed. |
| App Leftovers / Applications / Uninstaller | /Applications, /System/Applications, ~/Applications; bundle metadata, classification, protected Apple/running/self; preview+confirmation. No changes needed. |
| App Updater | Sparkle-only for self, honest unconfigured state, signature/notarization gates, no fabricated third-party data. No changes needed. |
| Space Lens | Explicit Not Scanned/Scanning/Partial/Denied/Measured states, measured sizes, bounded compact layout (fixed in earlier commits). No changes needed. |
| Startup/Trash/History/Permissions | Read-only by default, real items, Trash-only, exact history, FDA states + inaccessible list. No changes needed. |

## 6. Regression tests added

- `AppIdentityTests.swift` — visible name constant, bundle/display name,
  version == 1.2.0/build 8, badge format, strict version bump over 1.1.7
  (bundle assertions skip cleanly when not hosted in the app).
- `DuplicateFinderTests.swift` (extended) — modified dates + considered bytes,
  live stats callback, symlinks never followed/reported, default roots are the
  six visible user folders, no auto-selection/no auto-scan, sorting +
  Select All/Deselect All (keeper never selected).
- `LargeOldFilesRegressionTests.swift` — all five sort orders, tie stability,
  elapsed formatting.

## 7. Verification run — honest status

Executed locally on the Apple Silicon Mac:
- ✅ `git diff --check` — clean before the local fix.
- ✅ Native Xcode build succeeded for macOS Debug.
- ✅ Full XCTest suite passed after correcting the version-badge tooltip consistency test.
- ✅ Targeted `AppIdentityTests` passed.
- ✅ Built product metadata: `8002CleanUp`, version `1.2.0`, build `8`.

The Arena Linux report was not sufficient for native verification; this local
Mac run is the authoritative build/test result. Remaining compiler output is
warning-only Swift concurrency/API-deprecation guidance and did not fail the
build or tests.

No cleanup, no Trash move, no sudo and no system modification was performed
during this pass by the tooling (no macOS available); all destructive paths
remain preview-first and Trash-only in code.
